StarEngine: 2D Game Engine
==========

_Note:_ Their will be a compact website soon containing all the info below along with an embedding guide, downloads, tutorials and all the other resources you need to get started with the StarEngine.

StarEngine is a Game Engine to develop 2D Games fast and easy. It is written in C++11, but also allows you to write your games in C and ChaiScript. The goal is to allow very fast development, which is often needed in prototyping. Thanks to the many embedded opensource libraries we can provide you with all the features you might need. Keep in mind that we aim for a miniamlistic and compact game engine.

You can find more information at [our wiki](https://github.com/StarEngine/engine/wiki).

## Further Documentation

The documentation of our engine is generated via [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/). You can download the latest documentation our the StarEngine [here](#todo) (_comming soon_). You can also read our documentation in the header files of the engine code that allows you to write your game once, and deploy it on several desktop and mobile platforms.
